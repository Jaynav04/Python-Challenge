# Python-Challenge
During this Python exercise, I gained practical experience in importing modules such as csv and reading and writing files in different formats. Additionally, I was able to practice storing information in variables, lists, and dictionaries, as well as iterating through basic data structures and debugging throughout the process. Applying the knowledge acquired in my UT Bootcamp, I endeavored to deconstruct my assignments into manageable, bite-sized objectives.

PyBank-
In this Challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. YI was  given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

Create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

    The total number of months included in the dataset

    The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

    The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

    The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

    The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  
PyPoll-
In this Challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

I am given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". 

   Create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

    The total number of votes cast

    A complete list of candidates who received votes

    The percentage of votes each candidate won

    The total number of votes each candidate won

    The winner of the election based on popular vote
